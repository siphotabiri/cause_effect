            <h1>Straw Hat Crew</h1>
            <p>
                The <b>Straw Hat Pirates</b>, also known as the <b>Mugiwara Pirates</b>,
                <b>Straw Hat Crew</b> or simply the <b>Straw Hats</b>, are 
                an infamous and powerful pirate crew that originated from the East Blue. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The <q>Straw Hats</q> are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to
                him by <b><q>Red-Haired</q> Shanks</b> and are first referred to as the Straw Hat 
                Pirates by Smoker in the <b>Arabasta Kingdom</b>. The crew sailed on the 
                <b>Going Merry</b>, their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water
                7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a 
                new ship which was named the <b>Thousand Sunny</b> by Iceburg, even though the 
                members fought over different names.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the events on the <b>Sabaody Archipelago</b>, all the members were 
                separated from one another by <b>Bartholomew Kuma</b>, a then-Warlord of the
                Sea and undercover agent of the <b>Revolutionary Army</b>. For two years, 
                they trained in relatively isolated locations, becoming stronger for the 
                sake of helping each other. They then reunited and have since continued
                to be a dynamic force in the <b>New World</b>, greatly disrupting the balance of 
                the <b>The Three Great Powers</b>, which would eventually lead to their captain being 
                recognized as one of the <b>Four Emperors</b>.
