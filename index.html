            The <b>Straw Hat Pirates</b>, also known as the <b>Mugiwara Pirates</b>,
            <b>Straw Hat Crew</b>Straw Hat Crew or simply the <b>Straw Hats</b>, are 
            an infamous and powerful pirate crew that originated from the East Blue. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The <q>Straw Hats</q> are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to
            him by <b><q>Red-Haired</q> Shanks</b> and are first referred to as the Straw Hat 
            Pirates by Smoker in the Arabasta Kingdom. The crew sailed on the 
            Going Merry, their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water
            7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a 
            new ship which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg, even though the 
            members fought over different names.

            Following the events on the Sabaody Archipelago, all the members were 
            separated from one another by Bartholomew Kuma, a then-Warlord of the
            Sea and undercover agent of the Revolutionary Army. For two years, 
            they trained in relatively isolated locations, becoming stronger for the 
            sake of helping each other. They then reunited and have since continued
            to be a dynamic force in the New World, greatly disrupting the balance of 
            the Three Great Powers, which would eventually lead to their captain being 
            recognized as one of the Four Emperors.
